**Overview**
**LOCAL JARVIS** is an interactive web application designed to provide an AI-powered chat interface for answering questions and analyzing uploaded images. 
Utilizing the TinyLlama and Moondream models, the application offers both text generation and image analysis capabilities.
This application leverages the power of Streamlit for the web interface, alongside the Transformers library for natural language processing tasks.

**Features**
Text-Based Interaction: Ask questions and get responses using the TinyLlama model.
Image Analysis: Upload images for analysis and get context-aware responses using the Moondream model.
Model Switching: Easily switch between the TinyLlama and Moondream models to utilize the desired functionality.
Chat History: View a history of interactions to keep track of the conversation flow.
Real-Time Response Simulation: Experience a more natural interaction with simulated real-time data streaming.
Offline Operation: LOCAL JARVIS operates fully offline, ensuring no risk of data leakage as no external APIs are used.
Setup and Usage
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Streamlit
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Transformers library from Hugging Face
ollama library

Installation
**Clone the repository**:


git clone https://github.com/rehanali4790/OfflineGPT.git
cd local-jarvis
Install the required packages:

pip install streamlit pillow transformers ollama
Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
**Usage**
Open the Streamlit app in your web browser.
Type a question in the input box and click "Generate Response" to get a text-based answer using TinyLlama.
Upload an image if you want to use the Moondream model for image analysis.
Switch between models using the "Switch to JarVIS" and "Switch to VisION" buttons to toggle between TinyLlama and Moondream.
View the chat history to see past interactions.

**Application in the Government Sector**

LOCAL JARVIS can be a valuable tool in the government sector for various applications, including but not limited to:

Public Service Assistance: Providing citizens with quick and accurate responses to queries related to public services, regulations, and procedures.
Image Analysis: Analyzing images related to public safety, urban planning, or environmental monitoring.
Data Analysis Support: Assisting government analysts in processing and interpreting large volumes of text data, enhancing decision-making processes.
Education and Training: Offering interactive learning tools for government employees to better understand new policies, procedures, and technologies.
Healthcare: Assisting in telemedicine by analyzing medical images and providing preliminary assessments.
